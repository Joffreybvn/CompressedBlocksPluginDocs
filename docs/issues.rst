Any bug ? Any questions ?
=========================

.. warning:: Support is enabled only for the lastest release of the plugin (the one downloadable on the `Main page <index.html>`_). A bug or a question for a previous version won't be answered.

If you have any questions that is not answered in the `Faq <faq.html>`_, or if you encounter any bug, you can `open an issue on Github <https://github.com/Joffrey4/CompressedBlocksPlugin/issues>`_.

The project and its documentation are free and open-source, and are maintained during my free-time. Don't expect to get a reply immediately.
